# Weather-Demo

Using an API and JSON Parsing, I created a simple weather app that detects the users current location then hits the endpoint to get the weather conditions. 
Using the weather conditions and whether or not the sun has set, I display images describing the conditions accordingly. 
Background differs depending on light/dark mode. 
Not on App Store as it is a basic app to develop skills.
